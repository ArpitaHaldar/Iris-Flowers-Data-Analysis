**Introduction :**

The Iris dataset comprises 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers, with four measured features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It's widely used for practicing data analytics and machine learning algorithms due to its compact size and rich features. These features can be analyzed to classify Iris species or extract insights using database data analytics techniques.
